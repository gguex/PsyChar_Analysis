What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: Have at thee, coward. Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.
This by his voice, should be a Montague. Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave Come hither, cover’d with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; A villain that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night.
’Tis he, that villain Romeo.
It fits when such a villain is a guest: I’ll not endure him.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
Follow me close, for I will speak to them. Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me occasion.
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: Thou art a villain.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.
What wouldst thou have with me?
I am for you.
Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here, Shalt with him hence.
